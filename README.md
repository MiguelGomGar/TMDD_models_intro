# Introduction to Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD) Models

This repository contains **MATLAB** implementations of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models designed to study Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD).

The code and models are primarily based on the tutorial: *Dua, P., Hawkins, E., & van der Graaf, P. H. (2015). A Tutorial on Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD) Models*.

## 📋 Description

Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is a phenomenon characteristic of drugs with high affinity for their pharmacological target (such as monoclonal antibodies), where the drug-receptor interaction significantly influences the drug's pharmacokinetics.

This project breaks down the theory into three levels of complexity, ranging from static equilibrium to dynamic two-compartment models with approximations.
